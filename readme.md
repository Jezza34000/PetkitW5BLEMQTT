## Installation

To install the library, clone the repository and create a symbolic link to your Python library directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/slespersen/PetkitW5BLEMQTT.git
ln -s $(pwd)/PetkitW5BLEMQTT /path/to/your/python/site-packages/PetkitW5BLEMQTT
```

### Usage

`main.py` is provided for running the library. Below are the arguments it accepts:

### Arguments

- `--address`: (Required) The BLE device address.
- `--mqtt`: (Optional) Enable MQTT.
- `--mqtt_broker`: (Optional) The MQTT broker address.
- `--mqtt_port`: (Optional) The MQTT broker port.
- `--mqtt_user`: (Optional) The MQTT username.
- `--mqtt_password`: (Optional) The MQTT password.
- `--logging_level`: (Optional) The logging level. Default is "INFO".

### Example

Hereâ€™s a quick example to get you started:

sh

```
python main.py --address "A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6" --mqtt --mqtt_broker "broker.example.com" --mqtt_port 1883 --mqtt_user "user" --mqtt_password "password" --logging_level "INFO"
```

## Caveats

-   Device ID and secret have not been fixed.
    
-   Using the library, especially CMD 73, will set a secret that may interfere with the app's communication with the device.
